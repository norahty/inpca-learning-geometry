## Overview

This project studies **how deep networks learn over time** by examining their trajectories through an **information-geometric lens**.  
It uses *Information PCA (InPCA)* to embed probability distributions produced by a neural network at different training stages, allowing researchers to visualize and analyze how the modelâ€™s output structure evolves during learning.

## Goal

The goal of this tool is to provide an interpretable framework for **understanding the trajectories learned by deep networks** â€” how model predictions, viewed as probability distributions, move through space as training progresses.  

Rather than measuring performance alone, this approach focuses on the **geometric organization** of learning: how representations change, stabilize, or diverge as optimization proceeds.

## Method Summary

1. **Collect model checkpoints** at multiple training steps.  
2. **Convert outputs to probability distributions** (e.g., softmax predictions).  
3. **Compute pairwise Hellinger similarities** between checkpoints.  
4. **Apply double-centering** to obtain the InPCA embedding.  
5. **Visualize trajectories** in low-dimensional space to study learning structure.
